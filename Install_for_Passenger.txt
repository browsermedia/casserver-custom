BrowserMedia RubyCAS-server
===========================
This fork allows for multiple installations of rubycas-server on a single server. It does this by assuming that the
config.yml is located within the project itself i.e. /config/config.yml

See http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-server/wiki/DeployingUnderPhusionPassenger for additional potentially relevant info.

Installing for Passenger
=======================
$ cd /var/www/vhosts
$ git clone git@github.com:browsermedia/rubycas-server.git
$ mv rubycas-server cas.clientname.org
$ cd cas.clientname.org
$ mv config/sample.config.yml config.yml

Edit the config/config.yml to:
1. Set the correct database info (db, username, pw) for this CAS server (The MySQL db will need to be created as well.)
2. Set the correct paths for the log file (should be /var/www/vhosts/cas.clientname.org/log/casserver.log)
This config.yml file uses a Test Authenticator to valid with any username. 

Next configure Apache, adding the following to the vhost.conf

Listen 443
<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerAdmin admin@example.net
  ServerName login.example.net

  SSLEngine On
  SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/example.pem

  RailsAutoDetect off

  DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/cas.clientname.org/public

  <Directory "/var/www/vhosts/cas.clientname.org/public">
    AllowOverride all
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

An SSL certificate is required as well. Then restart apache.

Testing
=======
1. Go to https://cas.clientname.org. Should bring up the 'login' page.
2. Enter username as 'test' and password as 'testpassword'.

If everything is working, you should get a message saying login has worked. If you return to https://cas.clientname.org
there should be a messaging stating you are logged in as 'test'.
